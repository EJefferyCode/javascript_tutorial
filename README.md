<h1>This is a description of a simple Javascript Tutorial</h1>

<p>This repo contains a detailed and mostly grayed out explanation of several Javascript tricks and tips.</p><br>
<p>I had been learning JS, and I found that the best way to learn is to explain to others. Sometimes, teaching is the best way<br>
to dive right into a subject.</p><br>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions, or suggestions. Thanks!</p>
