        //var name = "Irina"; //always use numbers or underscores at beginning of variables.
        //document.write(name); //the result will be "Irina", because the most current result will take over.

        //var a = 20;
        //var b = 30;

        //var total = a * b;

        //window.alert(total); your total should be 600 in a pop up box. window.alert(total) is simply saying to the window "alert that I want to see the total of a * b."
            //concatenation
         //var firstName = "Emily";
         //var lastName = "Jeffery";  

         //document.write(firstName + " " + lastName); Make sure the N in lastName is always capitalized. Beware of not spacing correctly, as that can throw off your results.

        //document.write(friends[0]); //this will output Emily, as the string always begins as 0.
        //document.write(friends[1]); //this will output NYC.
        //document.write(friends[2]); //can you guess what this will output? :D

        //var friends = [["Emily", "NYC", 26], ["David", "Maine", 30], ["Aaron", "Ohio", 21]];

        //document.write(friends[0]); //The result should be Emily,NYC,26, because we targeted 0, and 0 is first, always. Try to get David,Maine,30 in your browser and Aaron,Ohio,21.

        //document.write(friends[2][1]); //This will yield the result of "Ohio".
